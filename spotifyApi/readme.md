# Spotify Api Practice

In this project, I tried to explore the spotify api.

get_token(): this function helps in getting access token

get_auth_header(token): constructs the header that will be sent in the request.

search_artist(token, artist): gets the id of an atrist

get_songs_by_artist(token, artist_id): gets the popular tracks of the artist
