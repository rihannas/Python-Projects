# Desktop Cleaner

As I'm studying and working I take a lot of screenshots and files on my desktop. I can't even tell what file is what. So this script helps me sort file with extension I usually work with.

This script helps me sort the files into specific folders: documents, images, audios and videos. Files with unknown extensions will be left on desktop.

I use the Path class from the pathlib module
I also use os and shutil
